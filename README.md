# Pull Stream UI Demos

This is a selection of demos that was originally put together and accompany [this presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DACmDIABSn0/ywcmRynKQwCnuCLu-eZcpA/view) presented at Canva's frontend engineering event series.

## Running the examples

To run the examples clone the repo and install all the things:

```
git clone https://github.com/DamonOehlman/pull-stream-ui-demos.git
cd pull-stream-ui-demos
yarn install
```

Each of the examples uses [`bde`](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/bde) to run (were setup to use different ports so I could demonstrate them both in the context of the presentation).

### Running the simple drawing demo

Run:

```
yarn simpledraw
```

And then browse to <http://localhost:8080/>

### Running the flickr example

Run:

```
yarn flickr
```

And then browse to <http://localhost:8081/>
